### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 part-1
  
    This lab is one of my favorites because it helped me understand how a
    real programming project is organized from the beginning. I learned how
    important it is to correctly fill out the AUTHORS.md file so the instructor
    knows who worked on the assignment, and that missing it can even cost all
    the points. I also practiced building programs with clang++ in the Bash
    shell and started paying attention to Google C++ style and meaningful git
    log messages. Overall, this lab made me feel more like a real developer
    instead of just someone writing random code files.

* Lab 8 part-1

   This lab was one of my favorites because it connected programming with something
   real, like how Olympic judges score athletes. I enjoyed implementing the algorithm
   that removes the minimum and maximum scores, because it felt like solving an actual
   fairness problem instead of just doing math. While working on the function, I learned
   how to pass vectors by const reference, how floating-point arithmetic affects accuracy,
   and why validating command-line input is important. This assignment helped me understand
   how small steps—finding the min, max, sum, and average—combine into a clean and meaningful
   function, and I felt proud when all the test cases finally passed.


* Lab 10 part-2

   This lab became one of my favorites because it was the first time I worked with a real
   dataset and used C++ to analyze meaningful information. I enjoyed calculating the densest
   and sparsest states because it required looping through a 2D vector, converting strings to
   numbers, and applying the population-over-land-area formula. It also taught me how powerful
   vector-of-vector structures can be, even when all values start as strings. Most importantly,
   this lab helped me understand how to separate code into headers and source files, and how
   unit testing (make unittest) can quickly reveal mistakes in my logic. Seeing the correct
   output for New Jersey and Alaska made the project feel both realistic and rewarding.
